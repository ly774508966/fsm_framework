A Finite State Machine framework using C# in Unity
==================================================

This is demonstrating a way to implement a finite state machine using C#.  This example is a Unity&reg; project, but the state machine framework design itself can be used in any C# project.  For a complete run down of the code check out [my blog](http://www.dannyb.me/posts/2014/01/fsm_framework/)!

### How to open and run ###

2. When choosing a project, navigate to where you cloned this repo and select that folder.
3. Once loaded make sure you load the scene.
